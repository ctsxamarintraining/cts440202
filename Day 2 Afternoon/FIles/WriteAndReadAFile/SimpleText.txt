Please follow object oriented programming while creating the below programs. Each program below should be written in a separate class and expose the functionality using methods and also write comments wherever necessary.

1. Write a program that reads a file and writes out a new file with the lines in reversed order (i.e. the first line in the old file becomes the last one in the new file.)

2. Create a folder with few nested files and sub-folders (not less than 3 levels). Write a recursive function to copy the source folder to a destination folder along with all the contents in it.

3. Create a file with text content (say more than 1Mb). Write a function which copies the contents of the file using Stream Reader/Writer with a help of byte array into another source destination. note: the byte array's maximum size should be declared as 500 bytes.

4. Using any Symmetric-key encryption algorithm.

5. Create an object of any class and serialize it to a file using JSON serialization. (use Newtonsoft.json NuGet package if needed).
